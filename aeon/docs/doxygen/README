This Doxyfile file will allow you to create API documentation for the Mace
Library (libmace.a).

Not only does it create HTML documentation, but it also creates man pages, and
supports (but does not generate) other outputs.

To create the documentation, you will need to install at least:

- doxygen
- dot
- latex

To generate the documentation, go to the mace/docs/doxygen directory, and run
$ cd mace/docs/doxygen
$ doxygen Doxyfile

Then you can view the documentation by viewing
file:///path/to/mace/docs/doxygen/html/index.html
