\begin{abstract}
\noindent
Mace is a programming language and toolkit for building robust and
high-performance distributed systems.  The Mace programming language
provides constructs to specify services, protocols, and distributed
systems as a composition of services, messages, and C++ code.  The
Mace toolkit provides implementations for many classes of services,
including routing, overlay routing, multicast, aggregation, HTTP, and
distributed hash tables.  The Mace toolkit also includes libraries for
encryption, string processing, file I/O, serialization, and XML-RPC.
